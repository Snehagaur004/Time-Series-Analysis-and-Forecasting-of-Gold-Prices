# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-of-Gold-Prices
✅ Situation – Analyzed 70+ years of historical gold price data (1950-2020) to detect trends, seasonality, and forecast future prices.

✅ Task – Develop a predictive model by combining time series forecasting and machine learning, optimizing model performance through training and tuning.

✅ Action –

--> Preprocessed and resampled data using Pandas for trend and seasonality detection.
--> Visualized patterns with Matplotlib & Seaborn to uncover key insights.
--> Applied Linear Regression for trend estimation and Naïve Bayes for probabilistic modeling.
--> Used Exponential Smoothing & Holt’s Method for time series forecasting.
--> Trained models on historical data and tuned hyperparameters to enhance prediction accuracy.
✅ Result – Improved forecasting precision through model optimization, enabling better gold price trend analysis and decision-making.
